# Topos Builders Program Milestones Guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> üì¢ This section only covers submitting finished payment milestones for the Topos Builders Program. You can find the application process [here](./README.md).

## üéØ Overview

Grants are awarded over two payment milestones. Grant Recipients submit a payment milestone issue through GitHub and a form. For the payment to be unlocked, milestone submissions will need to be accepted by Toposware Inc.

* Milestone 1 is for 20% of the grant payment, and submission is one week after the project kick-off.
* Milestone 2 is for the remaining 80% of the grant payment and is expected to be submitted at the end of the project timeline (from three to ten weeks, depending on the agreed timeline for the project).

You only need to submit a milestone for payment milestones. You should discuss with your Grant Sponsor how you submit additional development milestones. You should only have additional development milestones if you feel you will need support and check-ins with the team to move forward with your project.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Milestone 1

The submission date for Milestone 1 is one week after your project kick-off date.

**Milestone 2 requirements:**

* Code produced as part of the grant must be open source and must not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. Please license your code under Apache 2.0.
* Where applicable please document the areas below. Do not write detailed explanations of already existing components.
	* API calls
	* Architecture overview and individual component details
	* Algorithms and protocols that are core to your project
	* Any other fundamental building blocks to your technology
* For code-related deliverables, please follow the standard formatting guidelines native to the language the code is in. For any other deliverables, please commit to a particular style and highlight which official guidelines you adopt.
* Where applicable, please follow the testing guide.

## üß™ Testing guide

As this is a project on a testnet, you are not expected to create extensive testing. However, you will need to create sufficient documentation to allow the grant committee to test and assess your project.

Where applicable, please create:

### A guide demonstrating how your code achieves the milestones

Please provide documentation on how to install, compile, run and test the deliverable(s). Make sure to include all necessary prerequisites. Common issues while replicating test results involve, among others, undocumented dependencies, version numbers, local database setups, breaking changes in the main branch since delivery, and OS- and browser-specific incompatibilities.

Depending on the deliverable, this could include (but is not limited to)

* how to embed your library in another application,
* how to make example API calls to your service,
* running your web app,
* steps to complete some desired action in your mobile app.

### Unit tests

Where appropriate, each logical code component should be tested.

### Integration tests

Where possible Docker files are preferred, to avoid problems with versions and dependencies.

## ‚åõ After you submit your milestones

1. You will be notified within 5 business days if Milestone 1 is accepted and 10 business days if Milestone 2 is accepted.
2. If your Milestones are not accepted, your Grant Sponsor will contact you to discuss changes or improvements and the new timeline for submission.  You will need to follow their guidelines to make changes.
3. Payment for each milestone is in line with your Grant Agreement but is usually 14 days after your milestone is accepted.
