# Topos Builders Program FAQ

### How do I apply for a grant?

Application is a simple two-step process outline on the page ["How to apply"](./#-how-to-apply).


### How much could I receive in a grant?

Take a look at the current grants available on ["How to apply"](./#-how-to-apply). If the program is closed, please [sign up](https://builders.toposware.com/) to find out when new grants will be available.


### I have an idea but it's not one of the grants on offer. What should I do?

The most open option is the "Connector Grants". However, the Committee will prioritize proposals that connect to other blockchains, connect to new users or allow users to connect, collaborate or exchange value in a creative way. Your project can also significantly improve an existing product user's experience through interoperability or efficiency.

If your project doesn't fit into this category or any of the others on offer, it's unlikely you will be offered a grant at this time.  However, you can still contact [builders@toposware.com](mailto:builders@toposware.com) or jump into [Discord](https://discord.gg/zMCqqCbGMV) to find one of the DevRels. We are always open to new ideas.


### How do I publicize my grant?

We have some [announcement guidelines](./announcement_guidelines.md) that should help. We ask that you please don't publicize your grant until you have passed Milestone 1.


### What is a Grant Sponsor?

If your grant is approved and you have passed the acceptance process, you will be allocated a Grant Sponsor. They are an individual in the Topos Ecosystem who has been involved in the approval of your project and is interested in seeing you succeed. They are your representative to the Grants Committee and can sometimes be responsible for the approval of your milestones (this depends on the project.)  Your Grant Sponsor may also be able to put you in touch with other useful teams or projects in the ecosystem.

Do not ask your Grant Sponsor for tech support or about the grant process. You can find support for that here:

* If you have technical queries about Topos, in the first instance you should ask in the [Topos Discord](https://discord.gg/zMCqqCbGMV) private area.
* If you have process questions about the program itself you should email [builders@toposware.com](mailto:builders@toposware.com) (you can also ask in the Topos Discord, but if you want to be official – like requesting an extension – send an email).


### I can't get into the private area on Topos Discord.

If you have been approved and accepted onto the Topos Builders Program you should be onboarded into a private support area in the [Topos Discord](https://discord.gg/zMCqqCbGMV). If you can't see the private channels, email [builders@toposware.com](mailto:builders@toposware.com). Or ping a DevRel in the open Topos Discord.


### When is the project kick-off date/the Effective date? When can I start my project?

The Effective Date is the date on your Grant Agreement. The kick-off date is the start of the clock for your project timeline and milestone payment dates. The kick-off date is in your Grant Agreement in Exhibit A.

The kick-off date is important because you are expected to complete your first milestone one week after that date.

To have been accepted into the program, you will have completed the following steps:

1. Your project has been accepted by the Grant Committee.
2. You have filled in the acceptance form.
3. You have passed a short KYC process.
4. You have signed the Grant Agreement.

If you want to start your project before the kick-off date please go ahead! However, you will still need to complete the steps above before the kick-off date and they are necessary so that you can receive your Grant.


### Where do I find information and learning materials about the Topos Protocol?

Look at these [study materials](https://docs.topos.technology/).


### I'm stuck, where do I find support?

You have two places to find support:
1. Have a look at the [study materials](https://docs.topos.technology/) .
2. Jump onto the [Topos Discord](https://discord.gg/zMCqqCbGMV).

If you are part of the Topos Grants Program, you should have been onboarded into a private area on Topos Discord.  If you are not part of the grants program, you can still ask questions in the other channels.


### What if my project evolves and I can't build what was expected?

The Program will support projects and applications that have been defined in your application. That said, the Program is supportive of projects that evolve and deliver implementations that may differ slightly from the original plans.

Should there be significant changes or deviations to the original plans, please tell your Grant Sponsor as early as possible to ensure continued alignment with the intention of the Program. Also, email [Builders@toposware.com](mailto:Builders@toposware.com) to make it official.


### What is the difference between a payment milestone and a development milestone?

There are two types of milestones: payment milestones that are determined by the Topos Builders Program, and development milestones determined by you.

There are two payment milestones: the first is a week after the project kick-off date, and the second is at the end of your project's projected timeline. See here for more information on [payment milestones](milestone_guide.md).

You must create development milestones that sync with the two payment milestones. This is the minimum requirement.

If you wish, you can create additional development milestones that occur between the payment milestones. You should only do this if you feel you will need support and check-ins with the team to move forward with your project. Please do not create more than two additional development milestones.

This means you should have a minimum of two development milestones (to sync with the payment milestones). And a maximum of four development milestones.


### When are the payment milestones?

They are the two dates that you are expected to finish pre-agreed things to receive your milestone payment.

See more on this page about [milestones](milestone_guide.md).

There is also more information on submitting milestones in the [milestones submission issue](https://github.com/toposware/topos-builders-program/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Milestone+Submission&projects=toposware%2Ftopos-builders-program&template=milestone_template.yml&title=%5BMilestone+Submission%5D%3A+).


### I'm not going to hit my milestone. What should I do?

Email [builders@toposware.com](mailto:builders@toposware.com) as soon as you think you can't hit your milestone.  You can also contact your Grant Sponsor. If you can, don't wait until the milestone has passed to get in contact.


### What is the process for getting the payment milestones approved?

There is a simple three-step process outlined on the [milestone page](milestone_guide.md#-submitting-your-milestones).


### What happens if my payment milestones are not approved?

In the first instance, your Grant Sponsor will be in touch to talk you through suggestions and changes to your submission.

Generally speaking, payment milestone 2 is where problems occur, and it is normally related to testing. The best way to mitigate problems is to document your [testing](./#-testing-guide) processes thoroughly.

Once you have made the suggested changes, within the timeline agreed, your submission will be reassessed.

If you do not hit the timeline requested and you have been through two rounds of changes without improvement, it is likely your milestone will not be approved and you will not receive your grant.


### Who can I contact to find out more about the Topos Builders Program?

You can email [builders@toposware.com](mailto:builders@toposware.com) or jump into the Topos Discord and find a DevRel.
