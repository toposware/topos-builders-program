# Announcement Guidelines

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ðŸ“¢ Please **do not** make any announcements before the first milestone has been accepted by the Topos Builders Program. This is in order to protect the community from projects that only intend to use the grant announcement to raise funds or interest but don't intend to deliver on their proposed application. For this reason, the Program reserves the right to terminate grants if this rule is not observed.
>Once your milestone has been submitted, please send your planned blog post or press release to [builders@toposware.com](mailto:builders@toposware.com) for review. Please wait until the milestone has been accepted to publish your blog post or issue a press release.
>In your email, please let us know the following:
>1. Your planned publication date (taking into consideration that you must wait for the milestone to be accepted before publishing).
>2. If the post requires proofreading, or only needs content review before publishing.
>3. If you would like any cross-promotion, and if so, on what platforms.

## General guidelines for writing your blog post

* The post should be strategic in nature, focusing on the tech rather than the "announcement" element.
* Point to the work in order to attract attention to the project and demonstrate momentum in the ecosystem. The post should be informative for builders and the larger community.
* The post should include a link to a GitHub repository or elsewhere to showcase what has been built so far.
* Suggested flow for the post:
	* Overview of the planned technology.
	* What features the team has built so far.
	* The team's future development plans.
	* How the technology will contribute to the Topos Ecosystem.

## Key components

1. A blog post header image
	* An image helps when sharing the announcement on social networks. It's more prominent in feeds and looks polished.
	* Image ideas include showing how the Topos Builders Program or Topos Protocol fits into your flow. Or you can simply put the teams' logos next to each other.
2. About your team
	* This is a chance to share more about your team and grant project.
	* You can also highlight additional use cases for your grant project.
3. Why you chose to build on this tech stack
	* Illustrate the rationale for the relationship â€“ why did you decide to work with Topos?
	* Describe the benefits of building on the Topos Protocol and why it was important to have these features for your project.
	* Suggested benefits of the protocol include:
		* **Uniform security:** The safety of the Topos ecosystem is independent of the security of the participating blockchains (called subnets). It is computationally infeasible for malicious subnets to create invalid state transitions or to create conflicting states in order to double spend across the ecosystem.
		* **Scalability:** Topos provides an impressive degree of scalability and can handle an arbitrarily large number of blockchains without compromising performance.
		* **Privacy through zero-knowledge proofs:** In the context of Topos, ZKPs are used to prove that transactions are valid and their outcomes computed according to the rules of their subnet, all while keeping sensitive transaction details hidden. This technology represents a significant advancement in maintaining user privacy while retaining the ability to transparently verify the transaction history.
		* **Interoperability:** Soverign blockchains in the Topos ecosystem gain friction-free and secure interoperability out of the box.
4. Quote
	* Your CEO/CTO/Founder may want to include a quote of why they picked the Topos Builders Program or the Topos Protocol to help gain more visibility and traction in the market.
5. Description of Toposware
	* If you wish to mention Toposware or the Topos Protocol within the body of your text we recommend the following or similar:
		* Toposware is creating the technical groundwork for a new standard for Web3 while solving some of the hardest problems in cryptography and distributed systems.
		* Topos is the first Zero-Knowledge blockchain ecosystem that allows seamless and secure interchain communication without relying on trust in validators. Topos is creating the technical groundwork for a new standard for Web3 while solving some of the hardest problems in cryptography and distributed systems.
6. Social connections
	* The following text about Toposware's social presence can be added at the end of your article: "Learn more about Toposware by visiting [https://toposware.com](https://toposware.com) and stay up to date with the latest developments by following us at [https://twitter.com/toposware](https://twitter.com/toposware) and [https://toposware.com/blog](https://toposware.com/blog)."

## Recommended language

1. Don't use descriptors like "partner" or "partnership", "collaborations", "affiliate", "strategic" or "long-term" in these announcements.
2. Don't describe your technology as the "first" to build on the Topos Protocol, as timing for launch implementations across all our projects is indefinite.
3. Don't indicate that Toposware prefers a certain technology over all others:
	* As such, do not use phrasing such as *"Toposware recommends that teams use our tech to build X."*
	* Instead, speak to the merits of your tech: *"This technology provides great utility for the Topos Protocol through..."*

If you have any questions or would like to be included in our next announcement, please email [builders@toposware.com](mailto:builders@toposware.com).
