# Topos Builders Program

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è About
Welcome to the Topos Builders Program. This is the Testnet Cohort of the program, administered by Toposware Inc, a core community contributor to the Topos Protocol.

This Testnet Cohort will run until early January 2024. Successful grant recipients secure funding, and they will also have access to expert support and learning materials to get them building with the Topos Protocol. They will become a founding member of the Topos Protocol Community.

The Topos Protocol provides unique benefits:

* **Uniform security:** The safety of the Topos ecosystem is independent of the security of the participating blockchains (called subnets). It is computationally infeasible for malicious subnets to create invalid state transitions or to create conflicting states in order to double spend across the ecosystem.
* **Scalability:** Topos provides an impressive degree of scalability and can handle an arbitrarily large number of blockchains without compromising performance.
* **Privacy through zero-knowledge proofs:** In the context of Topos, ZKPs are used to prove that transactions are valid and their outcomes computed according to the rules of their subnet, all while keeping sensitive transaction details hidden. This technology represents a significant advancement in maintaining user privacy while retaining the ability to transparently verify the transaction history.
* **Interoperability:** Soverign blockchains in the Topos ecosystem gain friction-free and secure interoperability out of the box.

The Topos Builders Program is prioritizing applications with a focus on their utility. The goal is to support foundational projects that provide basic functionality on the Topos testnet. The Topos Protocol is EVM-compatible, therefore the Program is open to innovators to adapt and modify existing open-source applications to deploy on the Topos testnet.

## üß≠ Current Grants

There are five categories of grants available for the Testnet Cohort:

| Grant | Grant value | Expected time to build | About the grant |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Collectible Games | $5,000 in USDC. | Up to six weeks | Establish a thriving community of active gamers and generate demand for tokenized rewards that can be held and securely traded. The aim is to generate on-chain activity while remaining low-stakes in case of bugs and usability issues.<br/>See more [here](https://first-headlight-3fc.notion.site/Topos-Builders-Program-Collectible-Games-bf01e90819654ad09399f19362ed07b6?pvs=4). |
| ~~NFT Marketplace~~   | ~~$10,000 in USDC, plus a $5,000 bonus for implementation of auctions.~~ | ~~Up to eight weeks.~~ | ~~Create a marketplace where users can buy, sell and trade NFTs such as art, collectibles, music and more. Project developers looking for a decentralized and secure environment for creators and collectors to engage in transactions using ZK are in the right place.<br/>See more [here](https://first-headlight-3fc.notion.site/Topos-Builders-Program-NFT-Marketplaces-de693198caa94c6297b1edc47c3b46e7?pvs=4).~~ |
| DEX | $10,000 in USDC. | Up to ten weeks. | Build a platform that allows people to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other, without the need for intermediaries or a central authority. Zero-knowledge technology provides increased security, transparency and user control over funds while reducing the risk of hacks or manipulation. Project developers interested in creating DEXs with true resilience should start building with Topos.<br/>See more [here](https://first-headlight-3fc.notion.site/Topos-Builders-Program-DEXs-728d6d651c024adc9acb0e614ba23775?pvs=4). |
| Oracle | $5,000 in USDC. If successful, ongoing maintenance grants are possible. | Up to four weeks. | Deploying Oracles provides an essential service to both users of the zkEcosystem and those operating in the wider online world. This leads to increased awareness, involvement and adoption as outsiders become insiders. Connecting Topos to the rest of the web will be critical to decentralizing data.<br/>See more [here](https://first-headlight-3fc.notion.site/Topos-Builders-Program-Oracles-661146833be048d6820e8789a0edadd8?pvs=4). |
| Connector Grants  | Up to $10,000 in USDC. Contact the Topos Builders Program if you believe your proposed project warrants more. | Up to ten weeks. | Topos is the universal standard for a connected world. Therefore, to maximize a connected world we want builders who see connection as integral. This is the most open grants category, but the program will prioritize proposals that connect to other blockchains, connect to new users or allow users to connect, collaborate or exchange value in a creative way. Your project can also significantly improve an existing product user's experience through interoperability or efficiency.<br/>See more [here](https://first-headlight-3fc.notion.site/Topos-Builders-Program-Connector-Grants-451306c382ab4b229d3743f9d29375f8?pvs=4). |

## üí≤ Payment

Grants will be awarded over two payment milestones. Grant Recipients submit a payment milestone issue through GitHub and a form. For the payment to be unlocked, milestone submissions will need to be accepted by Toposware Inc.

* Milestone 1 is for 20% of the grant payment, and submission is one week after the project kick-off.
* Milestone 2 is for the remaining 80% of the grant payment and is expected to be submitted at the end of the project timeline (from three to ten weeks, depending on the agreed timeline for the project).

Find out more about the Milestones here: [Milestone Guide](./milestone_guide.md)

## üìã How to apply

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Application is a simple two-step process and needs to be executed in order:
>1. Create a new issue using the [application template](https://github.com/toposware/topos-builders-program/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Grant+Application&projects=toposware%2Ftopos-builders-program&template=application_template.yml&title=%5BGrant+Application%5D%3A+). Once you've filled in the template, submit the issue.
>2. Fill in an [application form](http://buildersprogram.toposware.com/applicationform). You will need to include a link to the submitted issue.

>[!NOTE]
>* Applications are open until EITHER the program receives its maximum number of applications OR 31st October 2023. This means you should apply as soon as you can to be sure your submission is included in this cohort.
>* Throughout the process, your email address will be your identifier. It is acceptable to use a temporary email address to preserve your privacy, but you must have access to the emails sent to that address for the duration of the grant period (up to 20 weeks). Not having access to the emails will mean you will not be able to receive your grant. It will not be possible to change emails during the grant period.
>* It is important to read the [T&Cs](https://github.com/toposware/topos-builders-program/blob/main/terms_and_conditions.md) as there are some exclusions and conditions that may mean you cannot be accepted for a grant.
>* To receive payments you will need to submit milestones that comply with our [Milestone Guide](https://github.com/toposware/topos-builders-program/blob/main/milestone_guide.md).
>* If you need more help, check out the [FAQs](https://github.com/toposware/topos-builders-program/blob/main/FAQ.md). If you can't find the answer you need, please [email](mailto:builders@toposware.com).

Application requirements:

* For most projects in this round of grants you need to be proficient in Solidity. Support and learning materials will be provided during your build phase to help you navigate the Topos Protocol, but not to learn Solidity.
* Code produced as part of the grant must be open source and must not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. Please license your code under Apache 2.0.
* We do not fund projects that have been the object of a token sale.
* We do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, or criminal activity.
* You must be eligible to receive a grant under section 2 (Eligibility) of the [T&Cs](./terms_and_conditions.md).
