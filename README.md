# Topos Builders Program

## ⁉️ About

Welcome to the [Topos Builders Program](https://builders.toposware.com/)! The Topos Builders Program promotes the development of the Topos Stack and the Topos Ecosystem by providing grants to projects that want to contribute. The program prioritizes applications with a focus on utility. The goal is to support foundational projects that provide basic functionality on the Topos testnet. The Topos Protocol is EVM-compatible, therefore the Program is open to innovators to adapt and modify existing open-source applications to deploy on the Topos testnet. The program welcomes open applications, allowing you to propose a project or innovative approach that aligns with our values. If selected, you will receive a grant multiplier, increasing the potential funding.

This is the GitHub repository including all information about how to apply for a grant from submitting an application to the terms and conditions, submitting Milestones after being accepted to the program, and announcing your participation in the program. The Topos Builders Program is administered by Toposware Inc., a core community contributor to the Topos Protocol.

The Topos Protocol provides unique benefits:

* **Uniform security:** The safety of the Topos ecosystem is independent of the security of the participating blockchains (called subnets). It is computationally infeasible for malicious subnets to create invalid state transitions or to create conflicting states in order to double spend across the ecosystem.
* **Scalability:** Topos provides an impressive degree of scalability and can handle an arbitrarily large number of blockchains without compromising performance.
* **Privacy through zero-knowledge proofs:** In the context of Topos, ZKPs are used to prove that transactions are valid and their outcomes computed according to the rules of their subnet, all while keeping sensitive transaction details hidden. This technology represents a significant advancement in maintaining user privacy while retaining the ability to transparently verify the transaction history.
* **Interoperability:** Soverign blockchains in the Topos ecosystem gain friction-free and secure interoperability out of the box.

The Topos Builders Program is prioritizing applications with a focus on their utility. The goal is to support foundational projects that provide basic functionality on the Topos testnet. The Topos Protocol is EVM-compatible, therefore the Program is open to innovators to adapt and modify existing open-source applications to deploy on the Topos testnet.

## 🧭 Current grants

You will find information on any currently open grants at our Toposware Visionary Initiatives landing page.

## 💲 Payment

Grants will be awarded over two payment milestones. Grant Recipients submit a payment milestone issue through GitHub and a form. For the payment to be unlocked, milestone submissions will need to be accepted by Toposware Inc.

* Milestone 1 is for 20% of the grant payment, and submission is one week after the project kick-off.
* Milestone 2 is for the remaining 80% of the grant payment and is expected to be submitted at the end of the project timeline (from three to ten weeks, depending on the agreed timeline for the project).

Find out more about the Milestones here: [Milestone Guide](./milestone_guide.md)

## 📋 How to apply

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Application is a simple two-step process and needs to be executed in order:
>1. Create a new issue using the [application template](https://github.com/toposware/topos-builders-program/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Grant+Application&projects=toposware%2Ftopos-builders-program&template=application_template.yml&title=%5BGrant+Application%5D%3A+). Once you've filled in the template, submit the issue.
>2. Fill in an [application form](http://buildersprogram.toposware.com/applicationform). You will need to include a link to the submitted issue.

>[!NOTE]
>* Throughout the process, your email address will be your identifier. It is acceptable to use a temporary email address to preserve your privacy, but you must have access to the emails sent to that address for the duration of the grant period (up to 20 weeks). Not having access to the emails will mean you will not be able to receive your grant. It will not be possible to change emails during the grant period.
>* It is important to read the [T&Cs](https://github.com/toposware/topos-builders-program/blob/main/terms_and_conditions.md) as there are some exclusions and conditions that may mean you cannot be accepted for a grant.
>* To receive payments you will need to submit milestones that comply with our [Milestone Guide](https://github.com/toposware/topos-builders-program/blob/main/milestone_guide.md).
>* If you need more help, check out the [FAQs](https://github.com/toposware/topos-builders-program/blob/main/FAQ.md). If you can't find the answer you need, please [email](mailto:builders@toposware.com).

Application requirements:

* For most projects in this round of grants you need to be proficient in Solidity. Support and learning materials will be provided during your build phase to help you navigate the Topos Protocol, but not to learn Solidity.
* Code produced as part of the grant must be open source and must not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. Please license your code under Apache 2.0.
* We do not fund projects that have been the object of a token sale.
* We do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, or criminal activity.
* You must be eligible to receive a grant under section 2 (Eligibility) of the [T&Cs](./terms_and_conditions.md).

## ⌛ After you apply

1. You will be notified within 10 business days if your application passes the initial screening.
2. If you pass the initial screening, your application is passed on to the Grants Committee.
3. You will be notified of the outcome of the committee meeting within five business days.
4. If you are awarded a grant, you will need to accept the grant and go through the acceptance process. Full details will be emailed to you with your notification of the award.
5. Your grant should not be treated as final, nor the funding as fully approved, until you have passed the acceptance process.

Applying for a grant through the Topos Builders Program makes you a founding member of the Topos Protocol Community! Topos is defining the future of equitable human interaction. This decentralized future will be inclusive, secure and interoperable by design.
